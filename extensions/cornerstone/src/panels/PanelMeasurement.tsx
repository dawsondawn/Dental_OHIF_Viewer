/**
 * The PanelMeasurement is a fairly simple wrapper that gets the filtered
 * measurements and then passes it on to the children component, default to
 * the StudyMeasurements sub-component if no children are specified.
 * Some example customizations that could work:
 *
 *
 * Creates a default study measurements panel with default children:
 * ```
 * <PanelMeasurement>
 *   <StudyMeasurements />
 * </PanelMeasurement>
 * ```
 *
 * A study measurements with body replacement
 * ```
 * <StudyMeasurements>
 *   <SeriesMeasurements />
 * </StudyMeasurements>
 * ```
 *
 * A study measurements replacing just the trigger, leaving the default body
 * ```
 * <StudyMeasurements>
 *    <AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *        This is a new custom trigger
 *    </AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *</StudyMeasurements>
 * ```
 *
 * A study measurements with the trigger and body replaced
 * ```
 * <StudyMeasurements>
 *    <AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *        This is a new custom trigger
 *    </AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *    <SeriesMeasurements />
 * </StudyMeasurements>
 * ```
 *
 * A study measurements with a custom header for the additional findings
 * ```
 * <StudyMeasurements>
 *    <MeasurementOrAdditionalFindings>
 *        <AccordionGroup.Trigger groupName="additionalFindings">
 *            <CustomAdditionalFindingsHeader />
 *        </AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *        <AccordionGroup.Trigger groupName="measurements">
 *            <CustomMeasurementsHeader />
 *        </AccordionGroup.Trigger>
 *    </MeasurementOrAdditionalFindings>
 * </StudyMeasurements>
 *```
